Welcome to Kluster it! a comprehensive Shiny application for performing clustering analysis on your data. This app provides several clustering algorithms and methodologies tailored to different data types and research questions.
This application was developed as part of my Master's thesis in Computational Social Science (CSS) at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M).
Further explanation on how to use the app can be found in the app itself. It can be accessed directly [here](https://bbanyulsuc3m.shinyapps.io/KlubKluster/) or by downloading the app.R file and the www folder (that contains some images for explanations).

Features
KMeans Clustering: Partition data into clusters based on the sum of squared Euclidean distances.
Club Convergence: Analyze convergence clubs using methodologies developed by Phillips and Sul.
Index Klub: Create a composite index from multiple variables and analyze convergence clubs.
